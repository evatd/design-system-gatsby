# Hi!

Welcome to The Stylist Group design system

<div style={{ maxWidth: "300px", marginBottom: "1.45rem" }}>
  <Image />
</div>

# Objectives

- Single source of truth: to provide a common language for our dev, design, editoral and business teams.
- Speed up design and development velocity
- Promote best practices for accessiblity, and reusable modules and styles
- Help create delightful, usable, and consistent UI across our products

#### We hope to accomplish these goals via:

- Breaking our UI into reusable modules and documenting them
- Serving as the standard for our design and development practices
- Reducing the number of decisions needed across the business when iterating
- Reducing code duplication

    Note: You'll also see a second link:
    `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to
    experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this
    tool in the [Gatsby
    tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

    Open the `design-system` directory in your code editor of choice
    and edit any `mdx` file in `src/pages`. Save your changes and the browser
