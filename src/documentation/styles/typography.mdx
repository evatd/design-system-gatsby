# Typography

## Typography Principles

- Our typefaces for Series (Hurme Geometric Sans 3, Noe Display and Ovo) are a reflection and extension of the Stylist brand. All considerations when setting type for Series should encompass the same design principles of the core Stylist brand.
- Typographic groups that are resilient, flexible, and reusable.
- Ensure sufficient colour contrast with background. Our contrast ratio is [6:00 and upwards](https://contrast-ratio.com/).

## Typographic Groups

Typeface styles are named based on their _appearance_ as opposed to their _purpose_. This affords flexibility and resusability by not limiting a variant to a specific role.
For example, `Toronto` could be used interchangeably as a heading as well as a body text link.

By default, each group is a `p` and has a `fontSize` of `"xs"`.

### Customising

Each group can be customised to fit your aim. Below is a list of properties we work with. These are also the properties we picked out and exposed in our `theme` object, as a part of our text styling API.

- font family
- front size
- line weight
- letter spacing
- line height
- text align
- color
- text decoration
- text transform
- space (includes margins, paddings)

To customise your component, pass down any of these properties in a view. This might look like this:

```
<Ljubljana
  is="h4"
  color="primary"
  fontSize={["sm", null, null, "md"]}
  letterSpacing="md"
  lineHeight="md"
>
    {text}
</Ljubljana>
```

### Responsiveness

We set responsive properties with an array syntax. The latter follows the [breakpoints defined in `theme`](tbc/layout), which are mobile-first.

In the `Ljubljana` example above, we are setting `sm` as our default `fontSize`, skipping small and medium breakpoints, and have `md` kick in on large screens. Like so:

```
fontSize={["sm", null, null, "md"]}
```

## Text Sizes

Text sizes are based on [power of twos](http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/mathematical-web-typography/#powers-of-two), with 16px base size.

We convert `px` values to `rem`, to give more control of text readability to the user.

| Text Size Name | Pixels | Rem   |
| -------------- | ------ | ----- |
| xxxs           | 12     | 0.75  |
| xxs            | 14     | 0.875 |
| xs             | 16     | 1     |
| sm             | 20     | 1.25  |
| md             | 24     | 1.5   |
| lg             | 32     | 2     |
| xl             | 48     | 3     |
| xxl            | 64     | 4     |
| xxxl           | 80     | 5     |
| xxxxl          | 96     | 6     |

## Tracking and Leading

Deciding the value is dependent on what best suits our product, however, readability is central. For actual values, _Zeplin_ is a good reference point.

We use larger letter-spacing on uppercase text and text against dark background.

The line height is larger in text-heavy layouts, e.g. body text, achieving a spacious typography setting.
